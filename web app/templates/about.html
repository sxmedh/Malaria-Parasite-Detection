      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p style="padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.2rem">
        Malaria remains a prominent issue in global health, especially in areas
        where advanced medical resources are scarce. Swift and precise
        identification of malaria parasites is vital for efficient treatment and
        control of the disease. Malaria diagnosis involves examining red blood
        cells. To detect malaria, centrifugal machines separate red and white
        blood cells, allowing only red blood cells to be analysed through blood
        films. Blood smears are a common laboratory test used for malaria
        diagnosis. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) serve as the primary method for
        diagnosing malaria across all healthcare sectors and in field settings.
        However, the accuracy of these antigen-based diagnoses through RDTs may
        be compromised due to the emergence of deletions in parasite antigen
        genes, as indicated in recent global literature. Conversely, the
        scarcity of highly skilled expertise in microscopy and the extended time
        required to read blood smears for precise malaria parasite detection
        make it exceedingly challenging to utilise in rural and remote areas.

      <p style="padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.2rem">
        As aforementioned, one of the challenges that researchers have faced in
        previous studies is the limited repository of Malaria datasets. In this
        study, we utilised Giemsa-stained thin blood smear slide images obtained
        from 150 patients infected with P. falciparum and 50 healthy individuals
        at Chittagong Medical College Hospital in Bangladesh
      </p>
      <p style="padding-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.2rem">
        We have achieved a 96 percent accuracy in detecting malaria parasites
        marks a crucial advancement in healthcare, enabling timely diagnosis and
        targeted treatment interventions. This high level of precision not only
        enhances patient care but also strengthens public health efforts,
        bringing us closer to the goal of eradicating malaria globally.
